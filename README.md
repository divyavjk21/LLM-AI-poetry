# LLM-AI-Poetry

This project explores emotionally expressive AI-generated poetry using prompt engineering and fine-tuned LLMs. We evaluate outputs across BLEU, perplexity, sentiment analysis, and human feedback to assess emotional alignment and poetic quality.

## 🧠 Exploring Emotional Depth in AI-Generated Poetry

This project investigates how to enhance the emotional quality of AI-generated poetry using large language models (LLMs) through:

- Structured prompt engineering  
- Fine-tuning on curated poetry datasets  
- Multi-layered evaluation: BLEU, Perplexity, Sentiment Analysis (VADER & NRC), and human feedback

## 📁 Files

- `NLP_Project_Report_Code.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preprocessing, prompt generation, model usage, and evaluations

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLM-AI-Poetry.git
   cd LLM-AI-Poetry
Install required dependencies (example):

📊 Evaluation Metrics

BLEU Score — Fluency and grammatical correctness
Perplexity — Predictive performance
Sentiment Polarity — Emotional alignment using VADER
Emotion Scores — NRC Lexicon matching
Human Evaluation — Survey feedback on poetic authenticity
